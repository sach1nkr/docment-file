              mobile computing and cloud computing, has become one of
              the industry buzz words and a major discussion thread in the
              IT world since 2009. As MCC is still at the early stage of
              development, it is necessary to grasp a thorough understanding
              of the technology in order to point out the direction of future
              research. With the latter aim, this paper presents a review on
              the background and principle of MCC, characteristics, recent
              research work, and future research trends. A brief account on the
              background of MCC: from mobile computing to cloud computing
              is presented and then followed with a discussion on characteristics
              and recent research work. It then analyses the features and
              infrastructure of mobile cloud computing. The rest of the paper
              analyses the challenges of mobile cloud computing, summary
              of some research projects related to this area, and points out
              promising future research directions.

              <p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;Over the past few years, advances in the field of network
                based computing and applications on demand have led to
                an explosive growth of application models such as cloud
                computing, software as a service, community network, web
                store, and so on. As a major application model in the era of the
                Internet, Cloud Computing has become a significant research
                topic of the scientific and industrial communities since 2007.
                Commonly, cloud computing is described as a range of services which are provided by an Internet-based cluster system.
                Such cluster systems consist of a group of low-cost servers or
                Personal Computers &#40;PCs&#41;, organizing the various resources
                of the computers according to a certain management strategy,
                and offering safe, reliable, fast, convenient and transparent
                services such as data storage, accessing and computing to
                clients. According to the top ten strategic technology trends
                for 2012 &#91;1&#93; provided by Gartner &#40;a famous global analytical
                and consulting company&#41;, cloud computing has been on the
                top of the list, which means cloud computing will have an
                increased impact on the enterprise and most organizations in
                2012.
                <dt style="text-align:justify;">Meanwhile, smartphones are considered as the representative for the various mobile devices as they have been connected
                to the Internet with the rapidly growing of wireless network
                technology. Ubiquity and mobility are two major features</dt></p>

          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 50px;">in the next generation network which provides a range of
            personalized network services through numerous network terminals and modes of accessing. The core technology of cloud
            computing is centralizing computing, services, and specific
            applications as a utility to be sold like water, gas or electricity
            to users. Thus, the combination of a ubiquities mobile network and cloud computing generates a new computing mode,
            namely Mobile Cloud Computing.
            As an inheritance and development of cloud computing,
            resources in mobile cloud computing networks are virtualized
            and assigned in a group of numerous distributed computers
            rather than in traditional local computers or servers, and are
            provided to mobile devices such as smartphones, portable terminal, and so on. (see Fig. 1). Meanwhile, various applications
            based on mobile cloud computing have been developed and
            served to users, such as Googles Gmail, Maps and Navigation
            systems for Mobile, Voice Search, and some applications on
            an Android platform, MobileMe from Apple, Live Mesh from
            Microsoft, and MotoBlur from Motorola. According to the
            research from Juniper, the cloud computing based mobile
            software and application are expected to rise 88% annually
            from 2009 to 2014, and such growth may create US 9.5 billion
            dollars in 2014.</p>
